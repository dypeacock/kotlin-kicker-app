# kotlin-kicker-app
This is the code for a rugby place-kick tracking app developed using Kotlin for my Mobile App Development module at University

I developed a native Android Application using Android Studio. 

I implemented the App’s functionalities in Kotlin using native Android API’s.

I created and used a bespoke Content Provider, made use of local storage, used Firebase for storing and retrieving data and ensured my app worked properly within the app lifecycle.
